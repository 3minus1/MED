Arduino code for flashing 5 LEDs according to the beat of the music. 


I have written this code for 5 LEDs but you can feel free to change the code according to any number of LEDs, you just have to tweak the code here and there a little; it's trial and error really.

I have assumed that you have connected the five LEDs to the Digital pins 5 through 9 of the Arduino. 
Connect your audio input to the Analog0 of the Arduino.
